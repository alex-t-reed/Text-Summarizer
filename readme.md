# Text Summarizer with Sentiment Analysis Web App

![Demo GIF](./demo.gif)

The Text Summarizer is a web application that leverages natural language processing techniques to create concise and coherent summaries from longer pieces of text. It simplifies the process of information extraction, making it easier for users to digest and comprehend voluminous content such as articles, reports, and documents.Additionally, it includes sentiment analysis for the original text.

This project builds upon previous work in the [NLP-Example Repository](https://github.com/alex-t-reed/NLP-Example), which contains Python scripts for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and text summarization.
